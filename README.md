While audio compression has been the most prominent application of digital audio processing, the gathering importance of data abundance is seeing growing applications of signal processing in audio segmentation and classification. Audio classification is a part of the larger problem of audiovisual data handling. Audio classification is also useful as a front end to audio compression systems where the efficiency of coding and transmission is facilitated by matching the compression method to the audio type, as for example, speech or music.  That is exactly what the problem description is in this competition! Identification of a wide variety of bird vocalizations in soundscape recordings which might have anthropogenic sounds (e.g., airplane overflights) or other bird and non-bird (e.g., chipmunk) calls in the background, with a particular labeled bird species in the foreground.
